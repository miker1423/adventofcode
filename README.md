# Advent of Code

## How to run
---
After clonning the repository and installing rust lang using rustup, run command 

```
cargo build
```

Then run the app as follows:
On Windows
```
target\debug\adventofcode.exe -p [problem-number]
```

On *nix
```
.\target\debug\adventofcode -p [problem-number]
```

Where problem-number is the number of the problem to run, currently only the first, second and fourth are implemented.
